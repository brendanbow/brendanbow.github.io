            <h3>The data:</h3>
            <p class="doc">The data for this interactive visualization is based on Dr. John Snow's map of London's 1854 cholera epidemic, and was provided by Dr. Khairi Reda <a href="https://khreda.com/teaching/2019/H517/project1/">at this link.</a> 
               It is important to note that the sex and the age of the victims are random and not historically accurate to the map at hand. These are instead based on a different cholera outbreak (in Naples, 1884).</p>
            <h3>The design process:</h3>
            <p class="doc">How did you go about designing the visualization? What are some of the initial designs/ideas you attempted in the beginning? [sketches]</p>
            <h3>Rationale of design choices:</h3>
            <p class="doc">This should be a rigorous explanation of the design choices you made. For example, why did you use color to encode a particular variable? Why did you arrange your charts in a particular way?</p>
            <h3>Reflection:</h3>
            <p class="doc">Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization. In this case, we have a clear hypothesis to start with, but are there other nuggets of insights one can uncover?</p>
